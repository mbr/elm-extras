# elm-extras

An experimental library. Do not use.

Collects various tidbits of elm code reused across project that is either too small for its own
library or has not found a proper home yet.

## Example use

```elm
import Extras.Html exposing (nothing)

-- ...

view =
    nothing
```

## Word of warning

Expect changes and breakage frequently. Do not use this.
